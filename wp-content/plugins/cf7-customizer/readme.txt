Nothing at the moment.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q1: Styles didn't show up after I saved and press 'x' in the Customizer?**

**Ans:** Press refresh, and clear the cache. It happens for reasons like, if:
* You use any caching plugin
* Your server has some cache generation
* You are using CloudFlare
So, just clear the cache and press refresh button on your browser a few times.

**Q2: I am unable to find CF7Customizer settings page? Where is that?**

**Ans:** I can understand that could be frustrating.
